# Wayfair_Program

For accessing my program, make sure the files provided in the email are 
together in one folder (let's call it "Wayfair_Program"). Make sure you have 
Microsoft Visual Studio installed with built-in Visual C++ environment set up.
Open the "Wayfair_Program" folder in Microsoft Visual Studio, open "wayfair_program.ccp", 
and run "hello-world.vcxproj" as the Startup Item.  Make sure that it is running the 
"wayfair_program.ccp" script.

When running my program, a terminal window would pop up on your screen. 
It will prompt you with a message, and you can press any key to continue. 
Then, it will ask you which of these planets is your favorite: Mercury, Venus,
or Neptune. You must spell out the name of one of these planets as shown 
(it is case-sensitive), and then press Enter to continue. The program will 
tell you how far your chosen planet is from the sun within our solar system. 
Then, you can press any key to continue, receive one final message, and then 
press any key to exit.
